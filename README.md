# Product-Classification-Challenge---Otto-Group
Machine Learning

The Otto Group is one of the worldâ€™s biggest e-commerce companies, with branches in more than 20 countries. The group sells millions of products worldwide every day, with several thousand products being added to their product line. Due to its diverse global infrastructure, many identical products get classified differently.

We will train a machine learning model from the Otto Group dataset which has 93 features for more than 200,000 products. The objective is to build a predictive model which is able to distinguish between our main product categories.
